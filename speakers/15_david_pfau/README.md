# Discovering the Geometry of Data Manifolds with Spectral and Deep Learning

## Abstract

A central tenet of machine learning is that complex high-dimensional data can be described by the structure of a low-dimensional latent manifold. However, most machine learning methods do little to exploit the rich toolkit of techniques for analyzing these manifolds. In this tutorial I will give a tour of how ideas from differential geometry and spectral analysis can be brought to bear on problems in machine learning. We will cover basic ideas in differential geometry such as curvature, metrics and geodesics, and go over how they relate to problems in spectral theory like Laplacian operators and computing low-rank matrix decompositions. We will survey applications to machine learning, including recent works on generalizing convolutional neural networks to graph- and manifold-structured input, analyzing the structure of latent spaces in deep generative models, and embedding hierarchical structure in continuous spaces. Finally, I will discuss spectral inference networks, a framework for unsupervised learning that uses the algorithmic tools of deep learning and stochastic optimization to solve large-scale spectral decomposition problems that would otherwise be intractable.
