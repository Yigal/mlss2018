# Learning Deep Learning from Scratch with MXNet/Gluon

## Abstract

This lecture introduces MXNet Gluon, a flexible new imperative interface that pairs MXNet’s speed with a user-friendly frontend. It allows users to seamlessly transition from imperative code to a symbolic graph representation. This allows for faster execution and deployment on a wide range of devices, including embedded ones. In the first part of the lecture, we will cover the fundamentals of Gluon: NDArray data structure, Block layer and automatic differentiation. We will show how to define neural networks at the atomic level and through Gluon’s predefined layers. We will demonstrate how to load data asynchronously, serialize models and build dynamic graphs. In the second part, we will focus on a specific deep learning task: semantic segmentation. We will show how you can implement and train a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to segment an image according to a set of classes. In the final part, we will go through the GluonCV (Computer Vision) and GluonNLP (Natural Language Processing) toolkits. You will learn how to leverage these two libraries to quickly replicate the results of state-of-the-art models in several tasks.
