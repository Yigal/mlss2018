# Generative Adversarial Networks

## Abstract

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a recently developed approach to learning generative models, in particular generative models capable of highly realistic synthesis. This tutorial will explore the GAN approach to generative models, comparing and contrasting it with more traditional generative model paradigms as well as other modern approaches based on neural networks. We will explore the practical considerations for effectively stabilizing GAN learning dynamics, as well as approaches to quantitatively evaluating the resulting models, and the current set of challenges at the frontiers of GAN and generative model research. We will also motivate the study of GANs from the perspective of successful applications to date, including domain adaptation, image-to-image translation, and single-image super-resolution.
