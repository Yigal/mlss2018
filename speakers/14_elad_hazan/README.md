# Optimization for Machine Learning

## Abstract

In this tutorial we'll survey the optimization viewpoint to learning. We will cover optimization-based learning frameworks, such as online learning and online convex optimization. These will lead us to describe some of the most commonly used algorithms for training machine learning models.
