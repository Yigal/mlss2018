# A Tutorial on Deep Probabilistic Models

## Abstract

I will give a tutorial on the interface between probabilistic modeling and deep neural networks.  The three primary topics of interest will be Bayesian neural networks, Boltzmann machines, and neural density models such as variational autoencoders.  I will provide an introduction to inference and learning in these models, and give an overview that connects modern approaches to the long history of probabilistic modeling with neural function approximation.
