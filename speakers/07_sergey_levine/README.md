# Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract

I will discuss reinforcement learning and control algorithms that combine high-dimensional parametric models, such as deep neural networks, with decision making and control. In particular, the lectures will cover policy gradient, value function-based, and actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning with function approximation, model-based reinforcement learning, and a number of advanced topics, which may include: the connection between control and probabilistic inference, inverse reinforcement learning, transfer, multi-task, and meta-learning for control, and applications in areas such as robotics.
