# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (+ bonus material)

## Abstract

We will begin with an introduction to fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning: policies, value functions, and planning in discrete environments.  Armed with this groundwork, we'll do some hands-on practicals to gain an intuition of these fundamental concepts/understand how even simple, discrete environments can exhibit interesting subtleties.   In the final session, we'll dive into a very specific use-case of reinforcement learning known as off-policy evaluation: if we have already collected data under one policy, can we reuse that data to guess how well a different decision-making strategy will perform?  I'll link this to some of our current work in applying reinforcement learning in healthcare.
